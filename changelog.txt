UPDATED (march, 2012), build 6.5.2012
FINAL VERSION! (again, *sigh*). 
Still some small issues found, so here's a final again. The fixes are minor though....
- Fixed a typo in the end demo screen
- Added an extra wall in room 604 next to the pillars, so you cant walk back
- Added an extra enemy in room 206 near the stairs, so now you must get the bullits to get through

=================================================================================================================

UPDATED (february 6, 2012): 
- FINAL VERSION! (again). 

I thought I was finished again, but I was not....
Because many people still find the game too hard, I decided to add checkpoints in the game (I call them
"timestones"). When lives is set to infinity and level is set to EASY or NORMAL, timestones are available in 
the game. At level HARD, no timestones are available.
 
All changes are as follows:
- ADDED: Timestones added as checkpoints for all temples. This way, player can save in a room.
  Timestones are turned on if lives settings is set to oo (infinity). In EASY mode, more timestones are 
  available to use, compared to NORMAL mode. HARD mode has no timestones.
  A Timestone contains:
    (1) Save    : Save checkpoint
    (2) Load    : Load checkpoint
    (3) Restart : Restart room
  When player dies, last checkpoint is loaded automatically (if a checkpoint was saved.)
  When entering a new room, the timestone is empty and cannot be loaded, until you save a checkpoint first in 
  that room.
- ADDED: Room 501, extra hint for hidden wall.
- ADDED: Corrected typo ("Bullet", instead of "Bullit")
- CHANGED: Room 501, removed spike left from hole, to make the jump a bit easier.
- CHANGED: Room 411, made path of vertical moving platform a bit longer.
- CHANGED: Room 513, made arrow faster, so you cannot escape it.
- CHANGED: Standing still "no bullit" enemy could not be killed by a bullit, but could be killed by dynamite.
           Now, he cannot be killed by ammo, only by an arrow. (room 513)
- CHANGED: Room 603, added extra wall. Will only open if all treasures are collected.
- BUG: When hitting F1,F2 or F3 on every first room of every temple, your ammo is gone. -> FIXED.
- BUG: Room 313: Almost impossible to jump in narrow passage from the right. -> FIXED.
- BUG: Room 508: When livingstone falls down off screen, it pops up on top of the room and stays trapped. 
  -> FIXED.
- BUG: Room 509: Player gets stuck when jumping against bridge from below, while a stone is on top. -> FIXED.
- BUG: Room 510: Moving platform and block cause bugs. 
  -> FIXED: Now, block is crushed when block is between platform and floor. Also, when two blocks move over 
  each other, blocks are crushed.
- BUG: Room 510: Room could be solved differently, which was not the intention. 
  -> FIXED. (removed brown block, and added hump)
- BUG: Room 512: Player should be crushed by platform when block is on top. -> FIXED
- BUG: Fixed some bug with Eagle Eye item and password system.
- BUG: Fixed spike bug in room 603 under the bridge.
- BUG: Changed sprite mask enemy to make the base 32 pixels wide, so player cannot stand close to enemy.
  (e.g. room 513, 604 could be solved differently).

Still, some bugs are not full fixed. I'm trying to solve them in the next build version, but they are not 
really urgent:
- BUG: Sometimes, player fall through platform when trying to jump on them. -> NOT FIXED YET.
- BUG: Room 510: Moving platform looses its path in certain occasions. -> NOT FIXED YET. 
- BUG: Room 511: Room could be solved differently, which was not the intention. -> NOT FIXED YET.

=================================================================================================================

UPDATED (june 2011): 
- FINAL VERSION! (2nd one)

I thought I was finished, but I was not....
Because many people find the game too hard, I decided to add "EASY" mode.
Now there is "EASY", "NORMAL" and "HARD" mode.

EASY MODE    : A lot of hints, and some minor level changes (some pits are smaller, 
               some arrows shoot slower, etc), for easy play.
NORMAL MODE  : Original mode, where the game should be played in.
               Reasonable amount of hints. Pits are wider, arrows faster, etc.
HARD MODE    : Almost no hints. Find everything out yourself. Very hard. Only for
               hardcore players, like people who can finish Rick Dangerous game with
               only 3 lives.

You can set the EASY, NORMAL or HARD mode in "OPTIONS" and then "LEVEL".
Default, the game is in NORMAL mode.

=================================================================================================================

UPDATED (may 2011): 
- FINAL VERSION! 
  build 2.00, can be seen in caption of intro screen window: use F4 to switch to window mode.
  It took me some time, but the game is finally finised!!!
  Total of 69 mindboggling levels. Ingenious level design!!!

- Challenges added : make it through a level as fast as possible, collecting all the lives and killing all the
  enemies for blue medals. (not needed to complete game, just for fun to see if you're a hardcore player)
- Debug mode is now off by default (can be set on with a password or cheat)
- Added password to jump to end demo. (yes, there is a end demo if you complete the game!)

If bugs occur (you can send me an email about it if you find something), I will deal with them, 
but in the mean time: ENJOY!!!!

=================================================================================================================

UPDATED (11th of june 2010): 
- Added a lot of hints 
- Added option for hints: [normal] = all hints, [hard] = only crucial hints

=================================================================================================================

UPDATED (24 may 2009):

=================================================================================================================

UPDATED (2 march 2009):

=================================================================================================================

UPDATED (1 february 2009): 
Changed a lot of stuff!
- Updated a lot of graphics! -  I changed a lot of tiles/bricks, and added a lot of new graphics to the game, 
  like vines, green stuff, wooden pieces, etc,etc. Levels look quite pretty now!

- Added extra sound effects when player hits water 
- Standard settings: unlimited lives (can be changed in "OPTION") 
- Debug cheat is on by default: 
     N   : next room 
     B   : previous room 
     F9  : save state 
     F10 : load state  
- And last but not least, I (FINALLY!) added duo play with Rick Dangerous!
  When you get to temple 6 (DUJO TEMPLE), you get to play with Rick Dangerous "Lost Viking" style! You control 
  both Lao and Rick and you have to work together to solve the puzzles. Rick can crawl and duck, jump higher and 
  further, but hates water and cannot hold as much ammo as Lao. Use each of their advantages to solve the room 
  and work your way deeper into the temple! Only 1 level is playable (room601). 
  Use password "SAAABQZWIZ" and jump directly to room601 and get control of Rick!
